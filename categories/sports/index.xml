      <description>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&#34;NBA Game&#34; src=&#34;http://hsu-ph.github.io/images/IMG_6453.JPG&#34;&gt;{style=&amp;ldquo;width:50%; height:auto; display:block; margin:0 auto;&amp;rdquo;}&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I went with a friend to see a regular season NBA game in Boston to watch the Celtics, and it was truly &lt;strong&gt;an unforgettable experience&lt;/strong&gt;! The atmosphere was &lt;strong&gt;electric&lt;/strong&gt; right from the start, with fans wearing green jerseys and chanting slogans. (Of course, we wore green too!)The moment the players entered the stadium, the crowd erupted, and the cheers were deafening. Being there, I felt an indescribable sense of &lt;strong&gt;unity&lt;/strong&gt; that you simply can&amp;rsquo;t experience on TV. The game was full of &lt;strong&gt;excitement&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;tension&lt;/strong&gt;. Celtics players played their hearts out, and every defensive and offensive play, especially a few key three-pointers, brought the atmosphere to a peak. Every time the Celtics scored, the entire crowd roared with excitement. Watching a game isn’t just about enjoying the sport; it’s a chance to share a memorable experience with friends. We discussed tactics, predicted the score, and even joked about some of the players&amp;rsquo; special moves. After the game, we went to neighboring stores to buy some souvenirs. This night truly made me appreciate the joy of live sports and the &lt;strong&gt;camaraderie&lt;/strong&gt; it fosters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
